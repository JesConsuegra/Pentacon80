# Pentacon80

![promisechains]
Adapter to use the Pentacon 80 projection lens on modern mirrorrless cameras.
Due to the fact that is a projection lens, it shows some limitations with this adapter: No infinity reachable, althoug
there is still a wide range of focal distances available, from macro to around 50m.

The adapter is designed to be used with a L39 adapter to whatever camera mount you are using. 
Nowadays the L39 adapters are cheap, the chinese ones for less than $5.
You can find some on eBay: 
- For u4/3 mirrorless cameras: http://www.ebay.es/itm/L39-M39-Lens-to-Micro-M-4-3-M43-Adapter-Ring-for-Leica-L39-M4-3-E-PM1-EM5-G3-GF5-/132041556430?hash=item1ebe4a41ce:g:omgAAOSw44BYW4pV
- For Sony-E mirrorless cameras: http://www.ebay.es/itm/Leica-L39-M39-Mount-Lens-to-Sony-E-mount-NEX-3-C3-5-5n-7-Adapter-Ring-L39-NEX-/142455864447?hash=item212b07fc7f:g:DfMAAOSwTFNZdp-2

The adapter is to be printed on a FFM 3D printer, typically Prusa I3.
Mine were printed on a M Prime One, using PLA, 0.1mm layers (needed for the L39 screw dimensions).

The adapter is made of five parts: the main body (printed barrel), where the P80 sits inside, 
the L39 adapter (acquired), one m4 nut and bolt (at the hardware store) to fix the lens to 
the barrel, a printed knob to twist the bolt, and a printed shade for the lens.
Being a projector lens it doesn't have any coating on the lenses, so a lot of flare
is being produced under sunlight. The shade alleviates de problem. It fits quite tight on the top of the lens just pressing it.
The knob is for a standard metric M4 allen head. Has to be superglued to the screw.
