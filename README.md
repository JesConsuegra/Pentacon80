# Pentacon80
Adapter to use the Pentacon 80 projection lens on modern mirrorrless cameras.

The adapter is designed to be used with a L39 to whatever camera mount you are using. 
Nowadays the L39 adapters are cheap, the chinese ones for less than $5.

The adapter is to be printed on a FFM 3D printer, typically Prusa I3.
Mine were printed on a M Prime One, using PLA, 0.1mm layers (needed for the L39 screw).

The adapter is made of five parts: the main body (printed barrel), where the P80 sits inside, 
the L39 adapter (acquired), one m4 nut and bolt (at the hardware store) to fix the lens to 
the barrel, a printed knob to twist the bolt, and a printed shade for the lens.
Being a projector lens it doesn't have any coating on the lenses, so a lot of flare
is being produced under sunlight. The shade alleviates de problem.
